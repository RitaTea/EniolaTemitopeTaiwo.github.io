								<p>This project was all about helping a big multinational company, Frocter & Kamble (F&K), get a better handle on their business.  They're a huge company with lots of different products, but they were facing some challenges.  Basically, they weren't as profitable as they could be, their sales were uneven across different parts of the world, and some of their marketing campaigns just weren't working very well.</p>
							    <p>So, i dove into their data to figure out what was going on.  I looked at their products like they were in a portfolio.  Some were "Stars" – doing really well, like their Health Care products, which were both profitable and selling a lot.  These were the ones to invest in and grow even more.  Then there were "Cash Cows," like Baby & Family Care – selling tons, but not super profitable.  These were the bread and butter, but i needed to find ways to make them more profitable.  Then there were the "Question Marks," like Personal Health Care – they had potential, but weren't quite taking off.  I needed to figure out what was holding them back.  And finally, there were the "Dogs," like Grooming products – not selling well and not very profitable.  I had to ask ourselves if it even made sense to keep focusing on them.</p>
							    <p>I also looked at their sales across different regions.  Africa and North America were doing great, but Europe and Asia were lagging.  That told me there was a huge opportunity to grow in those areas if i could just figure out the right approach.  And then there were the marketing campaigns.  Some were home runs, like Campaign ID 008 – it was killing it!  But others, like Campaign ID 009 in Asia, were duds.</p>
							    <p>I also realized that i needed to get better at understanding their customers.  I needed to use tools to figure out what people were saying online and group customers into different segments so i could target them more effectively.  And i needed to keep a close eye on how the campaigns were doing in real-time so we could make changes on the fly if needed.</p>
							    <p>The whole goal was to help F&K boost their profits, expand their reach into new markets, and make sure their marketing campaigns were actually working.  It was about using data to make smart decisions and help them grow sustainably.</p>
